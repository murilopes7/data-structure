# My C++ Projects

This repository contains personal C++ projects I am developing for learning and programming practice.

---

## 1. Exercises / Logic and Math Challenges

These are small programming challenges I solved in C++, organized inside the folder:

### Clickable Exercise List:

- [Collatz Conjecture](solutions/c/collatz-conjecture/1) – Implementation of the Collatz conjecture.  
- [Difference of Squares](solutions/c/difference-of-squares/1) – Calculates the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares.  
- [Grains](solutions/c/grains/1) – Problem of the number of grains on a chessboard.  
- [Leap](solutions/c/leap/1) – Checks if a year is a leap year.  
- [Queen Attack](solutions/c/queen-attack/1) – Determines if a chess queen can attack another position.  
- [Resistor Color](solutions/c/resistor-color/1) – Calculates resistor values from the color bands.

> Each link points to the corresponding folder containing the C++ source code.

## 2. Tic Tac Toe (Terminal Game)

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the terminal, written in C++.  

### Features:

- Two-player game.  
- 3x3 board displayed in the terminal.  
- Validates moves (does not allow overwriting occupied positions).  
- Automatically detects wins or draws.  
- Alternates turns between players.  

### Project Structure:

- [Tic Tac Toe](TicTacToe/) – Folder containing the game code.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murilopes7/data-structure.git
```

2. Go to the project folder you want, for example:
   
```bash
cd TicTacToe 
```

ou 

```bash
cd solutions/c/collatz-conjecture/1
```

3. Compile with g++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game   # or the corresponding file

```

4. Run

```bash
./game
```
